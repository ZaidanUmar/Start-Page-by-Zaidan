# Start Page

A customizable start page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering multiple columns and configurable link behaviors. Based upon [Excalith's Start Page](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page).

## Features

- **Multiple Column Layouts**: Supports two and three-column layouts for better organization.
- **Configurable Link Behavior**: Choose whether links open in the same tab or a new tab.
- **Real-Time Search**: Instant highlighting and dimming of links based on your search query.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Just download or clone and launch index.html.

## Configuration

Customize the behavior of the start page by editing the configuration variables in the index.html file.

<!-- Configuration Variables -->
<script>
  const openClicksInNewTab = false; // Set to true to open links in a new tab
  const openSearchInNewTab = false; // Set to true to open search results in a new tab
</script>


## Usage

    Navigating Links and search:

    Click on any link to navigate to the desired page based on your configuration.

    Use the search box to open links or google search.

    If the search term matches the title, it opens the link. If not, it does a google search. 

    Click anywhere outside the content area to reset the search and remove all highlights and dims.

    Hit tab to autocomplete.
